# GAN for MNIST Digit Generation

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook which demonstrates the implementation and training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow to generate digit images that mimic those in the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Implementation**: Utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, to build and train the GAN models.
- **Digit Image Generation**: Focuses on generating digit images, illustrating the capabilities of GANs in learning and mimicking complex distributions.
- **Model Architectures**: Details the architecture of both the generator and discriminator models, along with their training processes.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- imageio (for GIF creation)
- IPython display tools

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment to begin training the GAN and see the generated digit images.

## Usage

- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to setup, train, and visualize the results from the GAN. The notebook includes steps to generate GIFs of the training process.
- Visualize the progress in generating digits as the training proceeds.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you have improvements or want to adapt the model for other types of image generation tasks, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
